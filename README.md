# openTheology (proof of concept)
 This  will be my attempt at developing a webapp using an AI api.
## Bible Ai Intepretation
 I plan on using this project to help myself use AI intregation and develop more webapps. Ethically, this can be seen as a problem for some poeple, using AI to intrepret Bible verses, but before that let me explain what this app will aim to do. 
#### Uses
* Have a Bible API (perferably Logos) to use as the frontend Bible.
* Use AI to do the following
 *  Give Verses that go along with the verse or passage in question.
 *  Provide proper context to the verse or passage in question.
 *  Give interpretation for Bible verses or passages.
 *  Align towards a specific theological perspective, per user request.
 *  While also giving 'unbiased' and clear understanding of passages and verses.
 *  Give the Greek, Hebrew, or Aramiac of verses or passages.
 *  Give proper grammatical explanations of the origanal language of the verses or passages.

# Development
* Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
* Backend: Node.js (Express)
* AI API: Gemini
* Data Sources: bible-api.com, OpenBible.info, bible.js.org
* Bible Intregration: Logos API (fingers crossed) 

# Discretion Advised
As mentioned previously, this is going to be using AI to give such intepretations. I do not claim to any theological accidences or unproper detaling from the AI. It is likely that it will happen. Such is the way with using AI chat models. In the same vein, as a believer in Scripture, do not use this as a way to develop understanding soley, but think for yourself, that is why you have been given thoughts. Be mindful and aware when using this, know that AI can be wrong, and such a fault also lies with humanity; we are limited in the understanding of the Unlimited, whom is God.
